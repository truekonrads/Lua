Lua
===
This is a Lua build for meterpreter. It has been built on VS2012, so YMMV on earlier versions (e.g. the project file may not be up to date on VS2010).

The original Lua source code is availabe at [Lua.org](http://www.lua.org/download.html). Lua is free software distributed under the terms of the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html).
